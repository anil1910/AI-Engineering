# DVC Configuration for Student Score Prediction System

# This file demonstrates DVC (Data Version Control) setup for tracking data versions

# Data versioning enables:
# - Track changes to datasets over time
# - Collaborate on data with team members
# - Reproduce experiments with exact data versions
# - Store large files efficiently

# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Install DVC: pip install dvc
# 2. Initialize DVC: dvc init
# 3. Add data to DVC: dvc add data/Students\ Performance\ .csv
# 4. Track DVC files in git: git add data/Students\ Performance\ .csv.dvc data/.gitignore
# 5. Commit: git commit -m "Add data to DVC"

# DVC Benefits:
# - Version control for large datasets
# - Efficient storage with deduplication
# - Remote storage support (S3, GCS, Azure, etc.)
# - Seamless integration with Git

# Example workflow:
# - Modify data: Edit Students Performance .csv
# - Update DVC: dvc add data/Students\ Performance\ .csv
# - Commit changes: git commit data/Students\ Performance\ .csv.dvc -m "Update dataset"
# - Push data: dvc push (to remote storage)
# - Pull data: dvc pull (from remote storage)
